# WebDevEtc ContactEtc - A full contact form for your Laravel Project, including everything you need to install and get a contact form up and working almost instantly

## Fully customisable - lots of options to suit your needs.

- Set who to email to
- Customise the fields on your contact page(s), so you can have any number of fields. Fields are completely customisable
- Includes anti spam with recaptcha
- Supports multiple contact forms on one laravel app. Just copy/paste some route lines (and change them slightly) and it will be working straight away (see docs for details)
- includes view files. @extends("layouts.app") so it *should* work with most laravel installations (if not, its a simple edit to do)
- includes tests.



## installation guide

Please visit (the laravel contact form documentation here)[https://webdevetc.com/contactetc/]. The installation process only takes a couple of minutes, but there are a few things to be aware of.

## release history/change log

v1.0 - initial release (been using it on internal projects for a while, so it has been tested in the real world quite a bit)

## todo

Please let me know if any of these features would be useful for you.

- store submitted contact details in a database table (let me know if this is a feature that is useful?)
- add additional anti spam/captcha options, as not everyone will want to use the invisible recaptcha
- add <select> dropdowns. Is this someone people want on a contact form? please let me know
